I think about working on artificial intelligence as just making better computers.

Computers got me through the darkest parts of my life. They let me express the greatest parts of my mind. They gave me economic freedom. If I ask myself who I am and what I'm capable of, my answer includes a computer.

So this is the project I dedicate my life to - machines that improve the human condition. It's been in our DNA long before ImageNet. Developing our mind was in some sense, the first thing that made us human.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dream Machines</span>

What would the ideal computer look like? A device that can maximally "amplify our inherent abilities to spectacular magnitudes" - Ted Nelson's <span style="font-style: italic;">dream machine</span>?

If you squint and look across the last hundred years of visions, there are a few things they have in common.

First, you never have to learn how to use it. The thing shouldn't require you changing how you already communicate — it operates "as we may think".

You talk to them naturally. "Pull up this, move that over here, find me that."

The medium might be voice, touch, gesture, thought — one way to put it might be: In all the natural interfaces we have with the physical world, a dream machine should understand and extend them.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The New Knowledge Worker</span>

Imagine waking up one morning, going for a run, letting thoughts about your projects resume their shapes...

The new knowledge worker opens their workstation. They ask the system to resume their last project. They need to review information, forecast predictions. They ask the system to pull up relevant materials. They point at the cells of information most relevant to their task and command the machine to make changes or extrapolate from it. They ask the machine to conduct research, to find new information to fill values in the model they're working with.

They notice systems they dispatched earlier are off track. They stop them, tell them what to do differently, and set them off again. They spend much of their time reviewing, accepting, rejecting changes. They can roll back changes to earlier states, long after the project branched into its broken state.

They merge the content and style of documents together, never thinking about format unless they have a specific vision in mind. When it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> important, they can descend to that altitude and adjust the material exactly.

Most of the work happens in the mind. They sit, think, decide - the system carries out most of their actions.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Open Interpreter</span>

I've been on the road to dream machines since I was 14. My first attempt was an AppleScript that randomly wrote and executed code :)

Open Interpreter - really the first terminal agent, ancestor to Claude Code, Codex - was the first milestone on that road. Then came OS Mode, which was (maybe?) the earliest system that let any developer use computer-use models. The 01 was an attempt at building a voice-first platform. Actions was concieved to bring computer-use to the desktop.

All in pursuit of this question:

What is the next platform above classical computers that will give rise to dream machines? It should accommodate all the good ideas spread across these projects, and many other people's work, to be much greater than the sum of its parts.

This past summer, me and <a href="https://vic.so/" style="color: #ffffff;" target="_blank">Victor</a> might have found it. And honestly I haven't been this confident in a project since Open Interpreter itself.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Interpreter Workstation</span>

When I describe what it is today, it won't surprise you. But if you tune into the direction it takes over the coming months, I hope you'll see the dream machine in its future as I do.

It's called Workstation because it's inspired by the great workstation apps of our time: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, Chrome, Obsidian, Cursor, Docker Desktop, Arc, Ableton Live, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Blender. These work surfaces have defined my life and through them I have done my best work.

So, workstation is a heavy-duty desktop application. Instead of bargaining with different operating systems to control their apps, Workstation is doing something much more ambitious. It strives to be the primary work surface for the new knowledge worker.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">What Workstation Does Today</span>

You can open Workstation to any folder on your computer. If you've used Obsidian or Cursor, its interface will be immediately familiar.

You choose what file to view on the left, see that file in the center, and communicate with an agent on the right. Anything you select is visible to the agent. Any changes the agent makes can be rolled back.

It ships today with powerful agents like Claude Code and GPT-5, and lets you collaborate with them across familiar interfaces for documents, Word files, markdown, spreadsheets, and PDFs.

You can even use your own API key and base URL for free.

With the exception of markdown (incredibly useful for note-taking), these are the most boring interfaces we could have picked. But boring should be the domain of the machine: "I want something that does my laundry so I can make art, not something that makes my art so I can do laundry".

Interpreter Workstation is built on that principle. It's for work. Today, it's for people that work with local DOCX, PDF, and XLSX documents - and I know just about everyone does in some part.

I'm dying to know what you think. I'm especially curious if you're able to get Workstation to do something you don't like doing, or have visions for how it might.

I'm sending this to the some dozens of people who used Actions. All of us, including me, moved on from Actions for reasons I think I understand now. But it's only through seeing how Workstation fits into your work and life that we can know if this is the right path forward.

If I'm right, and this is the right foundation, then a few of you reading this are about to start the first of many days on Workstation. It may become the surface on which you do the greatest work of your life.

Welcome to Workstation.
