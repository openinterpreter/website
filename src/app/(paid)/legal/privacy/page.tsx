        <p>Open Interpreter Inc. (&quot;Open Interpreter,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; and/or &quot;us&quot;) values the privacy of individuals who use our application, websites, and related services (collectively, our &quot;Services&quot;). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and disclose information from users of our Services. By using our Services, you agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy Policy describes. Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of our Services is also subject to our Terms of Service.</p>
        <h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect a variety of information from or about you or your devices from various sources, as described below.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Registration and Profile Information</strong>: When you sign up for an account, register to use our Services, sign up for notifications or updates, or participate in our surveys, we may ask you for information such as your name and e-mail address.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications</strong>: If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you, such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide. When you communicate with us online, third-party vendors receive and store these communications on our behalf. If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will collect certain information from you, such as your email address. When we send you emails, we may track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve our Services.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Information</strong>: If you make a purchase through our Services, your payment-related information, such as credit card or other financial information, is collected by our third-party payment processor on our behalf.</li>

Additionally, if the language model executes code that reveals the contents of files on your computer, we may receive this information as well. It is important to carefully consider which permissions are granted, as allowing file access means that the application can see, modify, or delete files on your system. <strong>By approving these actions, you acknowledge that you understand the potential consequences, including unintended system modifications or data loss.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Usage Information</strong>: To help us understand how you use our Services and to help us improve them, we automatically receive information about your interactions with our Services, like the pages or other content you view, the searches you conduct, and the dates and times of your visits.</li>
